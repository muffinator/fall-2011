The Jupiter String Quartet performed at MIT's Kresge Auditorium at 20:00 on Friday, November 11th, 2011.  The group plays internationally and is widely acclaimed.  As a member of their audience, you become entranced in their work, as they craft a sort of dance with their bodies and transmit music of the ages through their instruments.
